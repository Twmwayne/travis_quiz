Created a multiple choice quize that tracks correct answers, responds if an answer is correct or wrong, and returns a percentage.
Quiz tracks high score, and name, and keeps the name.

Quiz contains buttons to return to main screen, view high scores, and start over.

Timer in the corner counts down from 30 seconds, and if reaches zero the quiz ends and you must start over.

If a question is answered incorrectly, 5 seconds are subtracted from the clocks remaining time.
